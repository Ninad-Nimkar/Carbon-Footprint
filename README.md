🌱 Carbon Footprint Tracker
A simple, smart, and AI-powered way to measure and improve your environmental impact.
🚀 Overview


The Carbon Footprint Tracker is a web-based tool designed to help users calculate their daily environmental impact based on:

🚗 Travel distance

⚡ Electricity consumption

💧 Water usage

The calculator converts these into a Carbon Footprint Score (Points) and stores entries using Firebase Realtime Database.
Users can then view trends, see their progress, and even get AI-generated improvement plans.
